# Axis Spine Manipulation Showcase

This Python project demonstrates custom axis spine manipulation using a 2×2 matplotlib subplot layout. Each subplot displays a unique function with stylized spines, custom labels, and minimal tick usage for a clean, modern dashboard effect.

## 🔧 Features
- 4 uniquely styled mathematical function plots
- Customized spine visibility, position, color, and thickness
- Minimalist aesthetic with no tick marks
- Centralized subplot labels with stylized font and positioning

## 📊 Functions Displayed
1. **Log Sign Curve**: Smooth symmetric log with sign-based direction
2. **Modulated Cosine**: Cosine modulated by a Gaussian decay
3. **Cubic Polynomial**: \( x^3 - 6x \)
4. **Sinusoidal Absolute**: Abs(x) modulated sine wave

## 🚀 Run the Project
```bash
python spine_visualizer.py
```

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## 💡 Learning Objectives
- Customize subplot spines for clean design
- Use mathematical creativity beyond textbook functions
- Combine aesthetics with functional layout in data visualization
